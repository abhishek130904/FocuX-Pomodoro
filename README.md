This app is designed for a standard Android phone size (approximately 6.3 inches). If run on larger or smaller screens, the app's interface may become distorted. Therefore, it is recommended to use it on a standard-sized device. I have tested it on the OnePlus Nord 2, and it runs smoothly. The app may also request permissions for scanning and other features; please allow these permissions for a successful installation.
