# FocuX-Pomodoro
This application is developed to support effective study practices by Pomodoro Technique. It enables users to engage in concentrated study sessions of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. The app allows for customizable timer settings, empowering users to adjust study durations according to their preferences. Additionally, it features a variety of notification sounds to indicate the start and end of sessions, enhancing user engagement and promoting sustained focus throughout the study period.

This app is designed for a standard Android phone size (approximately 6.3 inches). If run on larger or smaller screens, the app's interface may become distorted. Therefore, it is recommended to use it on a standard-sized device. I have tested it on the OnePlus Nord 2, and it runs smoothly. The app may also request permissions for scanning and other features; please allow these permissions for a successful installation.
